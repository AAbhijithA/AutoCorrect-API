# AutoCorrect API
### An Autocorrect API built from sratch using the Trie or Prefix Tree Data Structure along with FastAPI to handle asynchronous calls.

## Working 
![](Trie.jpg)
### Trie works by storing the prefixes in a Tree Data Structure, in our implementation we used the words from the text from from this repository, feel free to check it out [Link to Repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/tree/master) and the 'words_alpha.txt' was used since this implementation doesn't focus on special characters.
### The Trie stores the number of prefix count of the words traversed through the node, checking if the node so far represents the end of the word or not (checking if it's a valid word) for autosuggestion.
